Hello I am Rabi Syed - I am a late career changer trying to get back into coding.  
I gained a BEng (honours) in Electronic Engineering 2003 but choose a different path in terms of jobs.  
I would like to get back into coding and trying to learn HTML, javascript, SQL, and anything else inbetween. 
Recently completed a Level 6 short course in Creative Coding at NUA. 

Thank you for visiting!  :)
